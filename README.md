# 32-bit Multiply Accumulate ASIC
This ASIC implements a pipelined multply-accumulator for DSP applications. 
The design is field-programmable in the sense the engineer can define the data width using parameter statements for FPGA implementations.
The ASIC shown in the report screenshots is the 32-bit configuration for a 64-bit output bus.
